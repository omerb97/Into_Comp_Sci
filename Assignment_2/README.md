Assignment 2:
In the first part we created a program that calculated whether the dragons from Game of Thrones win a battle against an enemy using properties of the enemies name. 

Second part was about using one-dimesional array to organize platoons in an army

Third part was about creating a matrix calculator with addition and multiplication operations. 

In some parts we were required to use very few lines to achieve our goals had to use creative and non-intuitive ways to write our code.
