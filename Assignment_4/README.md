Assignment 4:
Part 1 deals with two dimensional arrays and pointers. We use them to create functions that handle the pricing of airline tickets and give statistics about them.
Part 2 deals with dynamic data allocations and strings. We use this to manipulate strings and "encrypt" them.
Part 3 was mostly dry and does not contain any real code.
